DEVELOPING
----------
After checking out the repository, run

    npm install
    npm run start

This should get you a locally running webserver which supports viewing a sample storyline and which supports automatic recompilation as code changes.

To test the current code, go to http://localhost:8080 As you make changes to the code, the browser should automatically reload, but if necessary, manually reload and see that your changes do what you want.

@TODO - add more information to help developers get their bearings and follow our best practices
